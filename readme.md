# Pacific Trails Resort

This repo contains the files for a project that is presented in:
> Web Development & Design Foundations with HTML5  
by Felke-Morris

The Pacific Trails Resort (vacation destination featuring yurts) project is an exercise in creating
a website using some of the advanced features of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It is a multi-page
site which is not responsive to mobile devices.

This repo contains my most recent version of this website. In addition to basic form, styling and
functionality, I've included the use of some audio/video to enhance the site. Basic form validation
is also included for user input in the reservation page.

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Codepen for testing grid layouts and various other ideas
- Audacity to create some short audio clips
